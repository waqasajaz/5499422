# Code Review and Unit Tests

Review [./lib/expandNamespace.js](./lib/expandNamespace.js). This code is used in our project to supplement this https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-namespaces.

We would like you to write Unit Tests in [./spec/expandNamespace.test.js](./spec/expandNamespace.test.js). We have provided you with 1 sample test.

## Hints

1.  If you need a refresher on unit tests, reading https://martinfowler.com/bliki/UnitTest.html might help
1.  The project mocha and chai frameworks, but feel free to use others
1.  Make it easy to the reviewer to understand your tests
1.  Have each test function test 1 thing
1.  Assume we want solitary tests (even though Martin Fowler is not a fan)
1.  Use tools like proxyquire or mock-fs to help with creating Test Doubles - both are available globally, so you don't need to require them (again, read Fowler if you are uncertain)

## Submitting your code

To submit your code, please create a public repository for this code on GitHub, BitBucket, etc. and copy the link to your repository to the _Dev Candidate Quiz_ form.
